  <h2>Content and Materials</h2>
  <p>
  I primarily make paintings based on photos, using acrylic paint on canvas.
  I am open to putting elements of several photos together in one painting
  and to discussing the possibility of other ideas you may have!
  </p>

  <p>
  The current canvas sizes that I have on hand are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>8&quot;&times;10&quot;, and</li>
    <li>9&quot;&times;12&quot;.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  If desired, I can obtain a canvas of some other size, but please note that
  this may extend the amount of time that it takes to complete the painting,
  depending on the current stock of local supply stores.
  </p>

  <p>
  If the painting is a gift, I can wrap it in some gift wrap with your choice of
  ribbon colour at no extra cost.
  </p>

<div class="dimmer-bg laser-border">
  <h2>Time</h2>
  <p>
  Commissions will generally take one-to-two weeks to complete, depending on
  commission specifics and whether there are any other projects currently in
  progress.
  I am open to discussing the possibility of a rush order, but, depending on
  how rushed it is, there will be an added charge for this.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="dimmer-bg laser-border">
  <h2>Delivery</h2>
  <p>
  If you are located in Calgary, I can hand the painting off to you in person at
  no extra cost.
  Otherwise, I am able to ship the painting for you and will invoice you for the
  shipping cost.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="dimmer-bg laser-border">
  <h2>Price</h2>
  <p>
  Before I start work on your painting, I will require 25% of the total cost as
  a deposit, and will request the remaining 75% upon completion, before delivering
  the piece to you.
  </p>

  <p>
  Prices are based on estimated number of work hours and material cost.
  Thus, exact commission cost will vary depending on canvas size,
  subject complexity, and desired level of detail of the subject
  and its background.
  </p>

  <p>
  To give an idea of this, here are two examples:
  </p>
  
  <div class="example-container">
    <div class="example laser-border-blue">
      <img class="painting-example" src="./paintings/purple_plymouth/preview.jpg"/>
      <ul class="example-breakdown">
        <li>8&quot;&times;10&quot;</li>
        <li>Blurry background</li>
        <li>~20 hours</li>
        <li>325 CAD</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="example laser-border-blue">
      <img class="painting-example" src="./paintings/red_jeep/preview.jpg"/>
      <ul class="example-breakdown">
        <li>9&quot;&times;12&quot;</li>
        <li>Detailed background</li>
        <li>~30 hours</li>
        <li>410 CAD</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
