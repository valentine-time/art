<article class="laser-border dimmer-bg">

<p>
Hi! I'm Valentine, a Calgary-based acrylic painter.
Valentine is a name with personal significance that I have chosen to make my art
under, but in my daily life I also go by Vitaliy, or variations of either name.
</p>

<p>
Art is something that I have always been naturally drawn to, but that ended up
on the back burner as school became much busier.
Last year I had the time to jump back into painting, and I am very glad that
art has come back into my life in such a big and unexpected way.
I'm very interested to see where following this path will lead me!
</p>

<p>
My formal education is in the field of computer science, which I hope to
continue to develop and pursue in parallel with my painting.
I have no formal art education, though I attended some informal art classes
under several different artists while in elementary school, so I am not entirely
self-taught.
</p>

<p>
Two of my main interests at the moment are pet portraits and paintings of cars.
These may feel like a strange combination, but both involve precision
and immense satisfaction when all their details come together into a
recognizable individual!
</p>

<p>
Outside of art, I like to hang out with close friends and family, experiment
with makeup and outfits, and take photos using my instant film camera.
