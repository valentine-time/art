<h2 style="text-align: center">About the Artist</h1>

<p>I primarily create acrylic paintings, and at the moment my main focuses are pet
portraits and cars!
Both are very satisfying to create, and require care and precision to get quite right.
Nothing grips the heart quite like hitting the mark with a clearly recognizable and
endearing pet in a portrait, or like sharp shines, gradients, and reflections on a sleek
car.
My goal is to continue to hone my precision and accuracy and to dip my toes more into
expressive and loose styles of painting.
I am excited to continue to expand my repertoire and grow as my art journey continues.</p>

<p>Art is something that I have always been very naturally drawn to, and is something that
I am very pleasantly surprised is returning to my life in a more significant way after
completing a university degree for computer science.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to hang out with close friends and family, experiment with
makeup and clothing, and take photos using my instant film camera.</p>
